# xyz-plot-grid
stable-diffusion-webui xyz-plot-grid

For automatic1111 stable-diffusion-webui.

Place xyz_grid.py in scripts folder along side other scripts.  
Works like x/y plot, like how you would expect, but now has a z.
Works like how you'd expect it to work, with grid legends as well.

Update 1: Each x/y/z is it's own grid, while a single one containing them all is provided.
This means the text position shifting off vertically, for the z, is no longer an issue.
It is possible for your text for the z to get too wide and overflow.
